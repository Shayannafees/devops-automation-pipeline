A personal DevOps project automating build, test, and deployment using GitHub Actions, Docker, and Flask.

# DevOps Automation Pipeline (In Progress)

This project aims to build a complete **DevOps automation pipeline** for a simple Python (Flask) web app.

The goal is to learn and demonstrate:
- **CI/CD** workflows using **GitHub Actions**
- **Containerization** with **Docker**
- **Automated testing** using **PyTest**
- **Cloud deployment** (Render / AWS EC2 - TBD)

##  Current Status
 Repository initialized  
 Setting up project structure and Flask app next  

##  Project Overview (Planned)
This project will simulate a real-world DevOps workflow:
1. **Build stage:** Code packaged into Docker image  
2. **Test stage:** Unit tests run automatically on push  
3. **Deploy stage:** Auto-deployment to cloud (optional)

##  Next Steps
- [ ] Add Flask app and basic test  
- [ ] Create Dockerfile  
- [ ] Configure GitHub Actions pipeline  
- [ ] Deploy app to cloud
